# WebCrawler

# Objective
To measure aspects of a crawl, study the characteristics of the crawl, download web pages from the crawl and gather webpage metadata, all from pre-selected news websites.

# Project Description
The main task is to configure and use the web crawler to crawl a news site.
The maximum pages to fetch is set to 20,000 to ensure a reasonable execution time for this exercise. 
Also, maximum depth should be set to 16 to ensure the crawling is limited.

The crawler will initially crawl various pages and urls fetched from the seed url. Basedon the pages fetched and visited, the program will generate a report providing detailed statistics of the nature of the pages crawled. 
The program will also generate csv files to keep track of the urls and associated statistics.
